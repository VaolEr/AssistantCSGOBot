## AssistantCSGOBot

This project is based on [Abios ESPORTS API](https://abiosgaming.com/) - the best api with the most detailed data and broadest coverage of matches!

As for me - it is a pet project for practice Spring, PostgresQL, communication with other APIs, Telegram Bot practice and improving my skills in Java.
